\section{Introduction}

XXX purposes of modularity: code reuse, program comprehension, and
interoperability.

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\em Reuse:} program modules should provide general behavior
    that may be used in a variety of contexts.
  \item {\em Comprehension:} partitioning code into modules reveals
    its high-level structure, enabling programmers to understand the system
    as a whole.
  \item {\em Separability:} a module may exist independently from other
    modules, for the sake of separate compilation or distribution.
  \item {\em Interoperability:} module implementations may change with
    time, and code that depends on those modules should not have its
    behavior change when the implementation does.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hypothesis}

\begin{quote}
  {\bf Our hypothesis:}
  {\em Modularity}, as a concept in programming, consists of many different
  constructs, each with different usability benefits. In particular,
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Language designers tend to have very similar goals in mind for
      adding ``modularity'' constructs to their languages, but the concrete
      results that they introduce solve distinct problems.
    \item Modularity constructs intended to enable code reuse,
      comprehension of high-level program structure, and interoperability
      serve orthogonal purposes, i.e. {\em programmers tend to use these
      constructs in ways for which the other constructs would not be
      suitable}.
    \item {\em Novice programmers are often confused about the
      distinctions} between different constructs for modularity and their
      alleged benefits. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{quote}
